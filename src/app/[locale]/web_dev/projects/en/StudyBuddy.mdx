## Overview

## Development
I began this site by creating HTML pages for each screen, styling them using CSS and Bootstrap. Then I made a PHP file for each page, each of which were connected to a central PHP controller. 
    After establishing a connection to a PostgresSQL database to store user information between sessions, I added JavaScript elements to create interactivity such as the live timer and leaderboard.
## Summary
A website for students and professionals to log their work by amount of time spent on each, allowing them to prioritize their neglected tasks and improve productivity.
