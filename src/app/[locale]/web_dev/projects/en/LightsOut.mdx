## Overview
I built a version of the game "Lights Out", where the goal is to eliminate the lights of all boxes on the board, but toggling a light on or off will also toggle all surrounding boxes.
## Development
I used JavaScript's jQuery library to implement the game, providing ease with toggling lights on and off. Before the game begins, the user can enter the size of grid they would like to play with, and a request is sent to a PHP backend file to randomly select a fixed amount of boxes on this grid that will start the game lit/ turned "on".
