## Overview
A modified version of Wordle, featuring words of varied length and unlimited guesses. 
## Development
This app was developed through Angular, which handles all of the user interactions and session storage with ease. The backend is handled by making a request to a PHP file, which then fetches a random word from a .txt file on the server.
