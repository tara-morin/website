## Overview

A mobile game created in Greece.

## Prototype

For this project we created a medium fidelity prototype and a high fidelity prototype. The medium fidelity prototype was implemented in Figma, and our intention was to implement the high fidelity protoype in a more advanced prototyping software, namely ProtoPie, but due to budget constraints we were unable to use this. Therefore our high fidelity prototype was created by modifying our existing prototype and elevating the user experience as much as possible.
