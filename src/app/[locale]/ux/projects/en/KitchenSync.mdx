## Overview

An all encompassing kitchen app.

## Prototype

We built the base of our prototype in Figma in order to easily style each screen, and then to increase interactivity we transported our Figma prototype to Framer. This allowed users to type in their own text when we were conducting evaluation testing of this prototype.

## My Role

I served as the project manager for my team, where I had many responsibilities. I created an agenda for and led our weekly meetings, kept track of the requirements and milestones need for each sprint of the project, and checked over all work published to our website. Under my leadership we received an overall A for the 4 submission phases of the project.
