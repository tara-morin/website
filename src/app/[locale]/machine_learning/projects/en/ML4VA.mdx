## Overview
This project was created for the Fall 2024 ML4VA competition, in which my team placed 3rd out of over 50 teams. The challenge was to apply machine learning to solve a problem in the state of Virginia. Our team located multiple data sets about Virginia public schools, with one of the many columns being SOL pass rates (SOL stands for Standards of Learning, the standardized testing for Virginia). We cleaned our data then built and trained models to see what factors were key in high SOL pass rates.
## Models Used
Random Forest, K-means clustering, Linear & Polynomial Regression, Neural Network
