## Overview
Based on attributes such as precursor awards, demographics, and box office statistics, I am creating a model that will succesfully predict which out of 5 women will win the Academy Award for Best Actress in a given year.
## Next Steps
I have extracted data from multiple sources, combined it into one dataframe, and filtered out unneccesary attributes. I am currently cleaning and standardzing the data, then will begin to use a linear regression model on the data.
